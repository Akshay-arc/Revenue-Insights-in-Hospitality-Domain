This Power BI project focuses on analyzing two distinct datasets—guest stay data and financial transaction data—to derive actionable insights through interactive dashboards. The Occupancy and Revenue Dashboard visualizes room booking trends across various hotel locations, seasons, and room categories, helping identify high-revenue zones and optimize pricing strategies. Simultaneously, the Spending Behavior Dashboard analyzes guest behavior, in-house purchases, and time-based spending patterns to uncover trends in guest preferences and detect anomalies or opportunities for upselling. These dashboards not only enhance data-driven decision-making for hotel management but also provide a scalable solution for improving revenue streams and guest satisfaction in the hospitality industry.
